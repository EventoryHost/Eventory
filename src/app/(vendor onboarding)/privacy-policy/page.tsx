All payment data is handled and stored by Razorpay. You may find their privacy notice link(s) here: [https://merchant.razorpay.com/policy/OkJ6MbLZTpio9S/privacy](https://merchant.razorpay.com/policy/OkJ6MbLZTpio9S/privacy).  

**Social Media Login Data.** We may provide you with the option to register with us using your existing social media account details, like your Facebook, X, or other social media account. If you choose to register in this way, we will collect certain profile information about you from the social media provider, as described in the section called "HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?" below.  

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.  

**Information automatically collected**  

In Short: Some information—such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics—is collected automatically when you visit our Services.  

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.  

Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.  

The information we collect includes:  

- **Log and Usage Data.** Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).  
- **Device Data.** We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.  
- **Location Data.** We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we

 may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location. You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location settings on your device.  
- **Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies.** We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in the section below titled "DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?"  

 

**7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**  
*In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.*  

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

 

**8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?**  
*In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.*  

**Withdrawing your consent:** If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

**Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:** You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you—for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

**Account Information:** If you would like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:  

- Log in to your account settings and update your user account.  
- Contact us using the contact information provided.

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms, and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

**Cookies and similar technologies:** Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at [privacy@eventory.in](mailto:privacy@eventory.in).

 

**9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**  
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

 

**10. DATA RETENTION POLICY**  
We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by law. Afterward, we securely delete or anonymize the data.

 

**11. VENDOR AND PARTNER AGREEMENTS**  
We ensure that all vendors and partners with whom we share user information adhere to our strict data protection standards and comply with applicable data privacy regulations.

 

**12. USER RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES**  
Users have the right to control their data, including the ability to opt out of certain data processing activities, request access to their data, or request deletion of their data.

 

**13. DATA SECURITY MEASURES**  
We implement robust security measures to protect user data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This includes encryption, secure servers, and regular security audits.

 

**14. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**  
Our services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it promptly.

 

**15. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?**  
*In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.*  

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
